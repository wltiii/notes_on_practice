= Retrospectives - Learning Through Reflection

== Reflection

=== Benefits Of Reflection

. Reflection strongly reinforces learning via retrieval and elaboration.

=== After Action Reports

. What was planned?
. What actually happened?
. What explains the difference?
. What can be done differently?

=== Other Reflection Questions

. What other knowledge or experiences does it remind you of?
. What other strategies might you use next time to get better results?
. What might you need to learn for better mastery?

== Impacts On Retrospective Practices

. Have daily "mini" retro with pair partner(s)

[quote,Rick K.]
Love the idea of a daily pair retro.
Will be thinking about what we would like to capture from each session -- work done?
Learnings?
Questions?
Rate your day?
